      <h2>What is Game of Life</h2>
      <p>
        Game of life is a <a>cellular automata</a> created by
        <a>John Horton Conway</a>, an English mathematician. It is a zero player
        game, which means the outcome is decided by the initial state. Initial state
        can be randomized, or customized by clicking on cells to flip
        their state.
      </p>

      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        1. When a cell is dead, but has exactly 3 alive neigbors out of 9, it
        becomes alive 2. When an alive cell has exactly 2 or 3 alive neigbors,
        it becomes alive, otherwise it becomes dead.
      </p>

      <h2>Organisms</h2>
      <p>
        Despite seemingly random and chaotic rules, various interesting
        organisms can occur with time
      </p>
